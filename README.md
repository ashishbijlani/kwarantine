# Code Coming soon

We've been working on a new [hypervisor](https://kwarantine.xyz) that can run strongly isolated containers. 

This is still a WIP, but we wanted to give the community an idea about our approach, its benefits, and various use cases it unlocks. Today, VMs are used to host containers, and make up for the lack of strong security as well as kernel isolation in containers. This work adds this missing security piece in containers. 

We plan on launching a free private beta soon. Meanwhile, we'd deeply appreciate any feedback, and happy to answer any questions here or on our [slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/kwarantine/shared_invite/zt-pzjlch5s-H610hE5y9fenswhPi2MVvg). 

Thanks!
